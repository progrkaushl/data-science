# Data Science With Python

This Project is collection of information and tutorial about various tools, techniques and methods used in Data Science comprising Data Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning.

# Data Analysis

Python have collection of some of the best libraries which rules in data analysis world. Most popular of them are:

|Lib name| Use case|
|--------|---------|
|numpy (Numerical Python)| Numerical computing|
|scipy (Scientific Python)| Scientific computing|
|pandas (Panel Data)| Data Wrangling and Analysis|
|matplotlib| Plotting and Visualization|
|seaborn| Statistical Data Visualization|
|scikit-learn| Machine Learning and Data Mining|


# SOL (Status of Learning)

Here status of learning of each of the 5 above mentioned libraries is mentioned in terms of **functions** (i.e. learning built in functions and methods in the library useful for data analysis) and **exercises** (i.e. putting learning about functions into test by solving question and test regarding individual library).

SOL for `functions` and `exercises` with be 0 (not done), 0.5(partially done) and 1 (done). Both has 50% weightage in overal SOL.

|Index |Lib Name| Functions | Exercises| Overall SOL|

|1|scipy|0|0|0%|
|2|pandas|1|0|50%|
